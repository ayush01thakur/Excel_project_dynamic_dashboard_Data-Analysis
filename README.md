# Excel_project_dynamic_dashboard_Data-Analysis
This is an Excel data analysis project, in which I have built the dynamic dashboard. This dynamic dashboard shows the data of CO2 and ch4 release in the atmosphere from 1990 to 2018. This has a navigation section where you can navigate and analyze the data accordingly.

Excel Dynamic Dashboard: CO2 and CH4 Release in Atmosphere
**Overview**
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Excel project, a dynamic dashboard visualizing CO2 and CH4 (methane) release in the atmosphere. This project uses Excel's powerful pivot tables to provide an interactive and insightful way to explore the dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dashboard allows users to gain valuable insights into the trends and patterns of CO2 and CH4 emissions over time.

**Features**
Dynamic Dashboard: The Excel workbook contains a user-friendly and dynamic dashboard that automatically updates based on the data in the pivot tables. Users can easily explore the dataset by selecting different options and time frames.

**Pivot Tables**: The heart of this project lies in the pivot tables created using the dataset obtained from Kaggle. These pivot tables provide a structured and summarized view of the CO2 and CH4 release data, making it easy to perform calculations and visualizations.

**Data Source**: The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle, which contains historical records of CO2 and CH4 release in the atmosphere. The dataset is pre-processed and included in the repository for easy access.
Also, I am providing the link below in the data sets section.

**Visualizations**: The dynamic dashboard incorporates various charts and graphs, such as line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts, to present the data visually. These visualizations help in understanding trends and patterns more effectively.

**Getting Started**
To explore the dynamic dashboard and interact with the CO2 and CH4 release data, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository or  **download it**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

Open the Excel Workbook: Once you have cloned the repository, open the Excel workbook

**Interact and Analyze**: Play around with the filters and pivot tables to gain insights into the CO2 and CH4 release trends. The visualizations will adjust dynamically based on your selections.

**Requirements**
Microsoft Excel is required to interact with the dynamic dashboard.
Data Source
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and is included in the repository under the data folder. The dataset has been pre-processed and formatted for immediate use in the Excel workbook.
